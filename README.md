Prerequisite

Then,
Clone this repo

To Install Dependencies Run-

```js
npm install
```
Config file is /config.js to add mongoDB credentials

The url is currently fetched from an inline variable on index.js and currently server is also being created in same file

I'll update this and write it in better and modular way.
